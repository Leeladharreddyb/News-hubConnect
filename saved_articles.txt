Title: Why Election Commissioner Arun Goel Resigned Weeks Before 2024 Polls - NDTV
Summary: Election Commissioner Arun Goel resigned on Saturday just days before the anticipated announcement of the schedule for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
Election Commission sources added that there have been differences on file between Mr Goel and Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.
He asked whether the current state of affairs warranted renaming the Election Commission to "Election OMISSION".
"In a sudden move, Election Commissioner Arun Goel has abruptly resigned.
That leaves the Election Commission now with just one Chief Election Commissioner," he posted on X.

Title: CAA rules notified: Here is what the 2019 Bill on Citizenship Amendment Act proposed | Mint - Mint
Summary: The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019 was passed in Parliament in December 2019.
The Bill proposed to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, and sought to make foreign illegal migrants of certain religious communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan eligible for Indian citizenship, according to PRS Legislative Research.
Before the new rules were implemented, the citizenship in India was regulated by the Citizenship Act, 1955.
All legal proceedings regarding their status as illegal migrants or their citizenship will be closed, the PRS Legislative Research said.
For the specified class of illegal migrants, the number of years of residency has been relaxed to five years.

Title: India notches MIRV tech success in Agni-V firing, Pakistan failed 3 years ago - Hindustan Times
Summary: On Monday evening, India test-fired Agni-V missile with three MIRVs over a distance of over 3000 km though the range of the missile is 5000 km.
Each warhead comes down at different speeds and hits the ground with some 200 kilometres separating the point of impact.
Pakistan and its big brother China will use the Agni-V test to ensure that Islamabad does not sign the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) citing asymmetric conventional force levels with India.
But the Agni-V MIRV is to deter expansionist China, which still covets parts of Indian territories after militarily occupying Tibet in 1950 using brutal force.
Due to multiple warheads, the Agni V cannot be intercepted by anti-missile shields as each nuclear warhead has different velocities and separate targets.
